# EasyReplaceCommand
This is a simple python script used to replace one string with another string in a given file.

## === WORK IN PROGRESS, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ===

Example:

    python Replace.py foo.txt apples oranges

    This replaces all instances of the word apples with the word oranges in foo.txt

Flags:

	-ts

	Replaces all tabs in a file with four spaces.

	-st

	Replaces all instances of four spaces with a tab.

Future plans:

	- Add option to specify how many spaces a tab equals
	- Improve Error handling
	- Add documentation to set up command line alias
